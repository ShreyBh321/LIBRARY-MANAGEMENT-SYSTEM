LIBRARY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM


PROJECT DESCRIPTION :
•	Library Management System is a project which aims in developing a computerized system to maintain all the daily work of library. This is a console application using the C Programming Language. In this console application, we can do basic library management task such as: add, delete, issue, return and search any book with an additional feature to view the list of all the books. To increase the readability, the tasks have been divided into different functions.
•	Library Management System is an application which refers to library systems which are generally small or medium in size. It is used by librarian to manage the library using a computerized system where he/she can record various transactions like issue of books, return of books, addition of new books, etc.
•	Book maintenance modules are also included in this system which would keep track of the students using the library. With this computerized system there will be no loss of book record and member record which generally happens when a non-computerized system is used. While adding any book to the system, a unique ID is auto-generated which helps in easy accessibility. Another unique ID is generated for every student who issues and returns a book to keep an easy track of each book and student. It also helps in maintaining a directory with the name and details of books and students (like due date, return date and late fee, if any).
•	There is a search window to display the availability of books and keep a record of all the books in the system. The system will be able to retrieve information of a particular book or student or the books checked out by librarian.
•	There is also an option to delete books from the system if they suffer any damage, are outdated or are no longer available in the library. The system will also be able to calculate total fine to be levied on any student who doesn’t return the issued book on the designated due date. 
All these modules are able to help librarian to manage the library with more convenience and in a more efficient way as compared to library systems which are not computerized.
It makes entire process online where student can search books and do book transactions. It also has a facility where student can see status of books issued. 
Overall, this project of ours is being developed to help the students as well as staff of library to maintain the library in the best way possible and also reduce the human efforts.
